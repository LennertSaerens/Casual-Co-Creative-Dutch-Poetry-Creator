# Casual-Co-Creative-Dutch-Poetry-Creator
In this paper, a co-creative Dutch poetry generation system is presented. The system implements a simple co-creative design pattern that allows its users to create poems line by line, starting from a number of keywords. The system uses a neural approach, consisting of an encoder-decoder architecture that uses a specialised RoBERTa model for the encoder and a specialised GPT- 2 model for the decoder. The evaluation shows that the system can create Dutch poetry successfully. Finally, an experiment enquiring into the satisfaction and fulfillment users might get from using a co-creative system to write poems, is proposed.
